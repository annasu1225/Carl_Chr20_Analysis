# Carl_Chr20_Analysis
Yale Gradute School module CBB752 final group project "Analysis of Carl Zimmer's Personal Genome."

Group members and contributions:
- Jiaqi Li: Part 1 Gene prioritization
- Keyi Li: Part 2 Protein structure analysis (AlphaFold prediction for mutant, lDDT score calculations)
- Anna Su: Part 2 Protein structure analysis (Pymol visualization and interpretation)

Carl’s germline SNPs are found here under Germline SNP call set for subjectZ. Coordinates are based on the
GRCh37 version of the human genome. The file is in VCF format. For more information about VCF, please see here.

Data for proteins in Part 2 are labeled with indices. Please see Protein.csv for the detailed information.
